## Executive Summary
Sweet Stacker is a new game that challenges players to stack as many ice cream scoops as they can while avoiding falling obstacles and bad ingredients! Catching the right ingredients will reward the player with 100 points, while catching the wrong ones will deduct one of their four lives. If players catch the falling ice cream cones, it will reset the stack of sweets and advance them to the next level, increasing the falling speed for higher points per sweet. However, the game takes a unique twist: if the player decides not to advance to the faster levels and avoids catching the cones to stay on the slower levels, once the cones hit the ground, they become an obstacle for the player to now have to jump over and dodge!

Time is of the essence in this game, as players must coordinate jumping over new obstacles and avoiding bad items in their stack. Each successful catch of sweets extends the time limit, so the player must focus to ensure there's enough time on the clock. Failing to catch enough ice cream will run out the clock, collisions  with cones on the ground will take away a life, and catching too many wrong ingredients will also cost a life. The goal of the game is to collect the highest score possible before four lives are gone or there's no more time on the clock. If either of these conditions happens, the game will end, and players will be sent back to the main menu.

## Game Description
### Overview
Overall this game portrays a simple adventure for a dog. The dog, Scoopy, uses his love for ice cream to complete the challenge of stacking as many scops as possible using only his nose.

### The Quest
In Sweet Stacker, players will immerse themselves as the main character named Scoopy! Scoopy's main quest centers around stacking as many ice cream scoops on his nose as possible, with each scoop earning the player points. The goal is to dodge falling obstacles and harmful ingredients that deduct lives. Players can strategically catch ice cream cones to reset the stack and progress to quicker, more rewarding levels. With an additional twist, opting to stay on slower levels introduces obstacles that must be jumped over, offering an extra layer of difficulty. Sweet Stacker tells the story of Scoopy's sweet tooth adventures for the most scrumptious ice cream tower. 

### Main Character
The main character of the game is a dog named Scoopy! Scoopy is a well-trained pup with a sweet tooth bigger than himself. He is an icy white dog with a big nose for balencing his favorite treats. Our beloved main character is equiped with a nice collar and a big tail.

### Menus
One menu will be implemented for Sweet Stacker. This menu will be accessed upon loading into the game, and after an unsuccessful playthrough, the player will be sent back to this main menu as well. On this menu, players will have the option to play or quit the game. There will be background music here, as well as a simple background screen including the name of the game. 
### Controls
The player will be able to navigate the world with their character with using their choice of either keys 'W,' 'A, and 'D,' or the left, up and right arrows to move left to right and jump. Additionally, the inclusion of the 'Space Bar' also allows for jumping.

### Sounds
There will be background music throughout the game, even on the main menu. The background music will be cheery and whimsical to fit the overall theme of the game. Each time an ice cream lands either on the ground or in your stack, it will play a squishy sound. When the player catches a cone to advance to the next level, Scoopy will bark, or if the player loses a life, Scoopy will growl. These sounds will bring the character more to life as these sound effects will be a way of expressing positive and negative emotions.

## Summary

Throughout this vibrant and happy world, there are unexpected obstacles that will try and ruin your stack and stop you in your (moose)tracks.
